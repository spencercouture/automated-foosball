# Automated Foosball Table
This is the repository that houses the necessary code to drive our automated foosball table.

## Dependencies
### Spinnaker SDK
One of the most crucial dependencies is the Spinnaker SDK to interface with the camera.
To install the SDK, download it from [here.](https://www.flir.com/products/spinnaker-sdk/)

Once the SDK is unzipped, running the installation script will put the proper libraries in the `/usr/include` directory.
